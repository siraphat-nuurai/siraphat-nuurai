üçÅ Introduction

Howdy Y'all! I‚Äôm Siraphat Nu-urai, also known as Zatin, a third-year Applied Mathematics student at King Mongkut‚Äôs Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL) in Bangkok, Thailand. With a strong passion for data science, I aspire to apply analytical and computational techniques to solve real-world problems. I believe in the principle: 'If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.'
