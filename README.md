Howdy, I'm Siraphat Nu-urai. You can call me Zatin. I am currently a 3rd year Applied Mathematics student at King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL) in Bangkok, Thailand. In the future, I aim to become a data scientist in Thailand. I live by the principle: 'If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.'
